# NestJS Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

This NestJS project is a robust and scalable backend application built using best practices and design patterns. It provides a solid foundation for developing RESTful APIs with TypeScript, featuring modular architecture, dependency injection, and comprehensive testing.

Key features:

- Modular architecture for easy scalability
- RESTful API endpoints
- Configuration management
- Logging and error handling
- Authentication and authorization
- Database integration (specify the database used)
- Comprehensive testing suite

## 2. Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [project-name]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in the required values in `.env`

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run start:dev
   ```

└── main.ts              # Application entry point
test/                    # End-to-end tests

## 4. Configuration

- Configuration is managed using the `@nestjs/config` package
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env` files
- Configuration types and utilities are located in `src/core/config/`
- Access configuration values using the `ConfigService`

## 5. API Documentation

The API endpoints are focused on managing notifications. Here are the main endpoints:

- `GET /api/notifications`: List all notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/:id`: Get a specific notification
- `POST /api/notifications`: Create a new notification
- `PUT /api/notifications/:id`: Update a notification
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id`: Delete a notification

Additional endpoints may include:

- `POST /api/notifications/send`: Send a notification
- `GET /api/notifications/user/:userId`: Get notifications for a specific user
- `PUT /api/notifications/:id/read`: Mark a notification as read

Detailed API documentation is available through Swagger UI at `/api-docs` when running the application in development mode.

## 6. Services and Modules

- `AppModule`: Main application module, configures global middleware and imports feature modules
- `NotificationsModule`: Feature module for the notifications API
- `NotificationsController`: Handles HTTP requests for notifications
- `NotificationsService`: Implements business logic for notifications
- `NotificationsRepository`: Manages data access for notifications
- `ConfigModule`: Manages application configuration
- `LogModule`: Handles logging and error reporting

Shared modules:
- `AuthModule`: Handles authentication and authorization (if implemented)
- `TokenModule`: Manages token-related functionality (if implemented)

The exact list of modules and their functionalities may vary based on the specific implementation of the notifications system.

## 7. Testing

- Run unit tests: `npm run test`
- Run e2e tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Run test coverage: `npm run test:cov`

Tests are located alongside the files they test, with `.spec.ts` extension for unit tests and in the `test/` directory for e2e tests.

## 8. Deployment

1. Build the application:
```

npm run build

```

2. Set production environment variables:
- Ensure all necessary environment variables are set in the production environment

3. Start the production server:
```

npm run start:prod

```

Note: The specific deployment process may vary depending on your hosting platform. Always refer to your hosting provider's documentation for the most accurate deployment instructions.

## 9. Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch
2. Make your changes, following the coding standards outlined in the project
3. Write or update tests for your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass and there are no linting errors
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes

Coding Standards:
- Follow TypeScript best practices and use strict types
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clean, modular, and testable code
- Document public APIs using JSDoc comments
- Follow the project's folder structure and naming conventions

Pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers before merging.
